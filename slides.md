# What is Rust?
## (Baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more)
* Multi-paradigm. Functional, imperative, object-oriented, whenever it makes sense.
* Low-level. Targets the same problem-space as C and C++
* Safe. Lovely, lovely types and pointer lifetimes guard against a lot of errors.

---

# Where can I get it?
* Prebuilt binaries are available at http://www.rust-lang.org/
* Source code is available from GitHub https://github.com/mozilla/rust
* You can also use Aptitude to install nightly builds (DESCRIPTION)

# The traditional Hello World 

!!!intro.rs

* It's very C-like. Curly braced.
* Semicolons aren't needed in a lot of cases. They imply 'new statement' rather than end of line, so if you want your function to return a value, you leave it off (or use the return keyword)
* It uses macros in places. Printing to the console is a macro.
