# What is Rust?
## (Baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more)
* Multi-paradigm. Functional, imperative, object-oriented, whenever it makes sense.
* Low-level. Targets the same problem-space as C and C++
* Safe. Lovely, lovely types and pointer lifetimes guard against a lot of errors.

# Where can I get it?
* Prebuilt binaries are available at http://www.rust-lang.org/
* Source code is available from GitHub https://github.com/mozilla/rust
* You can also use Aptitude to install nightly builds (DESCRIPTION)

# Basic Rust program

* Everything's an expression, and therefore typed.
