Rust is a Staticly typed systems programming language specifically designed for safety. Using the magic of types and functional programming, we get the ability to write fast, safe, concurrent code with fine-grained control over memory management - all without dreaded null pointers and memory leaks! Oh my!

So, where do we get Rust from? It's developed by Mozilla and you can get prebuilt binaries [here]. However, the language is in pretty much constant development, as it's not reached  If you're using Aptitude as a package manager, you can get nightly builds. If you feel particularly brave, you can compile from source.

So, let us see the classic Hello World.

fn main() {
    println!("Hello!")
}

So, there we've got function definition, and also a macro for spitting things out.
